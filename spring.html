          <font size="5">Hi</font>, I’m 19 and I just got let off school for spring break.
            I haven’t seen a lot of sharing/stories* for the war in
            Ukraine (nothing wrong with that, ig it's just kind of disappointing when you hope to see 
            some but end up seeing none). But It's not like I'm really helping either since I haven't 
            shared anything at all either, so I’m hypocritical on that. </p>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica">
          <font size="5">So, </font> <!-- </font></p> -->I thought I’d make a list of sources or anything to help you
            stay informed & to help support the people in Ukraine. You don’t
            have to donate or anything, but I think staying informed is
            good… And then who knows, it might lead you to want to donate
            which is also good</p>

          <!-- <h3>SO WHAT?</h3> -->
          <p>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica">
          <font size="5"> There’s</font> a variety of options and specific fields in which you
            can help donate, for example, shelters,
            towards families(renting out airbnbs is one I heard),
            weaponry, etc… Personally, I don’t think I’m going to donate
            towards weaponry but it’s your choice on whatever you want to
            donate to.</p>

          <!-- <h3>LIST</h3> -->
          <p>
<font size="5">I</font> found this list off reddit and this is just half of what they
            provided. If you want to learn more about it, download reddit on
            your phone or just use your computer and search up “reddit” on
            google or whatever search bar you use, then on reddit’s search
            bar -> “Ukraine” -> in communities tab, click on the first one
            listed.</p>

           <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/s6g5un/want_to_support_ukraine_heres_a_list_of_charities/">
            https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/charities</a>
            or if just want to explore around the community and see live
            reports then that’s fine also. Though I’m not exactly sure about
            the credibility of everything and you would need to do your own
            research on posts & charities. <- or just scroll through the
            comments and see what they say.

            <font size="5">Finally,</font> youtube is a good way to stay informed if you don’t like
            reading that much. Though, if you are on your phone, it might be
            hard to actually keep up with the news on Ukraine because there’s
            no list of news/trending tab on your home screen. You would need
            to click on the actual news tab to actually get the news, and that
            makes it hard to stay informed mindlessly. If you were on your
            desktop/computer on the other hand, the videos and news would
            be on your homepage. And that makes it easy to stay informed, m
            indlessly/without having to really do much clicking.
