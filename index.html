<h1><center>War in Ukrain</center></h1>
<p>Hi, I’m 19 and I just got let off school for spring break.
<br>
I haven’t seen a lot of sharing/stories* for the war in Ukraine and it’s kind of disappointing, even though I don’t share anything either so ig I’m hypocritical on that.
<br>
So, I thought I’d make a list of sources or anything to help you stay informed & to help support the people in Ukraine. You don’t have to donate or anything, but I think staying informed is good… And then who knows, it might lead you to want to donate which is also good
<br>
There’s a variety of options and specific fields in which you can help donate, for example, shelters, towards families(renting out airbnbs is one I heard), weaponry, etc… Personally, I don’t think I’m going to donate towards weaponry but it’s your choice on whatever you want to donate to.
