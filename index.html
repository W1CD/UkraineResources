          <h3>WHY</h3>
          <p>Hi, I’m 19 and I just got let off school for spring break.
            I haven’t seen a lot of sharing/stories* for the war in
            Ukraine and it’s kind of disappointing, even though I don’t
            share anything either so ig I’m hypocritical on that. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          <h3>SO...</h3>
          <p>I thought I’d make a list of sources or anything to help you
            stay informed & to help support the people in Ukraine. You don’t
            have to donate or anything, but I think staying informed is
            good… And then who knows, it might lead you to want to donate
            which is also good</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          <h3>SO WHAT?</h3>
          <p>There’s a variety of options and specific fields in which you
            can help donate, for example, shelters,
            towards families(renting out airbnbs is one I heard),
            weaponry, etc… Personally, I don’t think I’m going to donate
            towards weaponry but it’s your choice on whatever you want to
            donate to.</p>
